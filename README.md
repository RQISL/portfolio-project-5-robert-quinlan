# Create design UX for the Art Gallery site

*  [The RZ Collection](https://rzcollection.com/artists/ilgvars-zalans) website showcases stunning and seamless layout transitions that have inspired me during my exploration. The user experience (UX) on this site is truly remarkable, prompting me to develop my own UX concept. However, creating a design UX requires a significant amount of time, which unfortunately poses a challenge.

# Wireframe 

* # Design wireframe UX for Desktop & Mobile
* A design UX that is almost similar to the one developed for the site. Please note that while the design UX may not be exact, it is still of the highest quality and has been developed with utmost care and attention to detail. 

* ## Desktop

* ## Mobile

## Moodboard
* The moodboard is a visual arrangement of images, materials, and text that aims to evoke a specific style or concept. It serves as a helpful tool to visualise the design direction for the website. In this particular moodboard, I have included labeled images for the hero cover background, color palettes, and the font choice of Roboto for all the text, while using Agbalumo for the head title and logo. 

* Please note that the logo was conceptualized and created separately, and you can find a link to it here. The moodboard was created using the Adobe Illustrator app. Please refer to the image below for a visual representation.

![Wireframe Mobile](media/ReadMe/moodboard/Moddboard%20for%20desgin%20UX.png)

## Colour Palette

* This moodboard features a visually appealing background cover image with a combination of dark grey, pink, and blue color palettes. However, to enhance the contrast, we have modified it by replacing the colors with bright green and dark green. The new color scheme creates a pleasant and friendly aesthetic, making it more visually appealing. Please refer to the attached image for a better understanding.

### 6. User's Editable

* As **<u> An additional feature for 'user's editable':**</u> For my development project 5, I used the Agile management concept to manage the user story. However, I realized that this approach did not sufficiently focus on the user's needs. Through manual testing, I learned the importance of incorporating user stories into the user interface concept in the development process. Moving forward, I will ensure that the user's needs are prioritized in the development site in the future. 

* As **<u>HTML</u>** I can create **<u>an editable checkout page, allowing users to update or remove items as needed</u>** So that **<u>while completing their purchase.</u>**


| Feature | Action | Expected Result | Actual Results |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| User's editable | <ol> <li>Checkout page</li> </ol> | <ol> <li>User click 'Update' and 'Remove' buttons </li> <ul><li>User click 'Update' on the button and activate alert box</li> <li>User click 'Remove' on the button and activate alert box</li> <li>User click 'Remove' on the button and activate checkout page, it is empty the basket</li><li>User click 'Keep Shopping' on the button and activate category painting page</li></ul> </ol> | <ol> <li>Works as expected</li> <ul><li>Works as expected</li><li>Works as expected</li><li>Works as expected</li><li>Works as expected</li></ul> </ol> |

In the case of a minor discrepancy, such as a button placement in the bottom footer, we have made a conscious decision to maintain the original style without making any changes. Rest assured, this will not affect the overall user experience or functionality of your website.

## The lighthouse runs testing and results.

* This [Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-art-gallery-elena-d4d9090ab15b-herokuapp-com/3fwzmsh2yy?form_factor=desktop). is a test tool that analyzes the performance of a website on both desktop and mobile devices. It provides insights and recommendations based on the results obtained from running the test.

* The test results indicate that the mobile performance of the analyzed website is relatively low, suggesting potential areas for improvement. It has been proven to improve website results, even in cases where responsive images have caused performance issues. I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints.

* ### See attached results for both Desktop & Mobile:

## Validation testing

### HTML
* Run testing using [The 3WC HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for Home, About Us, Category Painting, Shop, Search Product, The Product Management, Profile, Login, Sign-up, Logout, and Contact pages have been meticulously reviewed and corrected to ensure optimal functionality. Our overlay model login and signup buttons remain unchanged. All passed!

### CSS
* Run testing using [the official (Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS. It was all passed and no errors.

### Python

* [The CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) is a powerful tool designed to identify and fix errors in Python code. With its extensive testing capabilities, it thoroughly scans your code and provides detailed feedback on any issues it finds. While it successfully resolves most errors, there may be a few instances where it is unable to make the necessary corrections. Additionally, there have been occasional issues with the tool causing errors when running the site. However, despite these minor setbacks, the CI Python Linter remains a reliable and effective solution for ensuring the quality and correctness of your Python code.

### The devices

## Resource & tutorial
* ### I learned as many resources as possible I learned how to use Create for the cart, profile, and CRUD.

### Resources and tutorials:
* Most of the time I learned walkthrough at Aoutique Ado as it follows on my project 5 but mostly, I modified the way of site I created. I had quite an improved familiarity with Django and I enjoyed but it needs further experience to improve my skills in the field of Django. 

## Technologies Used

1) [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) I have used it since the beginning of Project 5

2) [The CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) is a powerful tool that allows you to run tests and identify errors in your Python code. By using this linter, you can easily fix any bugs and ensure the quality of your code. Additionally, I found [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier#) to be extremely helpful in reducing stress and quickly identifying errors. This Python formatter and beautifier simplifies the process of finding and fixing errors. Simply copy and paste your code into the CI Python Linter, and it will highlight any errors for you to address. However, please note that some code may still have errors that cannot be changed to avoid any issues with the site.

3) [Heroku app](https://www.heroku.com/) - The deployed to activate the browser.

5) [3WC HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - Run testing for any errors to fix the bugs

6) [3WC CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  - Run testing for any errors to fix the bugs

7) [Bootstraps 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ )  - I used Bootstrap 5.

8) Adobe Illustrator - I use it to design logos.

9) Adobe Photoshop - I use it to edit images.
