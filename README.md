# Create design UX for the Art Gallery site

*  The RZ Collection website showcases stunning and seamless layout transitions that have inspired me during my exploration. The user experience (UX) on this site is truly remarkable, prompting me to develop my own UX concept. However, creating a design UX requires a significant amount of time, which unfortunately poses a challenge.

# Wireframe 

* # Design wireframe UX for Desktop & Mobile
* A design UX that is almost similar to the one developed for the site. Please note that while the design UX may not be exact, it is still of the highest quality and has been developed with utmost care and attention to detail. 

* ## Desktop

* ## Mobile

![Wireframe Mobile](media/ReadMe/wireframe/Mobile_full_1.png)


## Moodboard
* The moodboard is a visual arrangement of images, materials, and text that aims to evoke a specific style or concept. It serves as a helpful tool to clearly visualize the design direction for the website. In this particular moodboard, I have included labeled images for the hero cover background, color palettes, and the font choice of Roboto for all the text, while using Agbalumo for the head title and logo. 

* Please note that the logo was conceptualized and created separately, and you can find a link to it here. The moodboard was created using the Adobe Illustrator app. Please refer to the image below for a visual representation.

* * ![Wireframe Mobile](media/ReadMe/moodboard/Moddboard%20for%20desgin%20UX.png)

## Colour Palette

* This moodboard features a visually appealing background cover image with a combination of dark grey, pink, and blue color palettes. However, to enhance the contrast, we have made a modification by replacing the colors with bright green and dark green. The new color scheme creates a pleasant and friendly aesthetic, making it more visually appealing. Please refer to the attached image for a better understanding.

* I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints. However, I plan to conduct more thorough testing on Safari in the future, as I have found its developer tools to be superior to those of Chrome, which we typically use.
