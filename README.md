# Create design UX for the Art Gallery site

*  The RZ Collection website showcases stunning and seamless layout transitions that have inspired me during my exploration. The user experience (UX) on this site is truly remarkable, prompting me to develop my own UX concept. However, creating a design UX requires a significant amount of time, which unfortunately poses a challenge.

# Wireframe 

* # Design wireframe UX for Desktop & Mobile
* A design UX that is almost similar to the one developed for the site. Please note that while the design UX may not be exact, it is still of the highest quality and has been developed with utmost care and attention to detail. 

* ## Desktop

* ## Mobile

## Moodboard
* The moodboard is a visual arrangement of images, materials, and text that aims to evoke a specific style or concept. It serves as a helpful tool to clearly visualize the design direction for the website. In this particular moodboard, I have included labeled images for the hero cover background, color palettes, and the font choice of Roboto for all the text, while using Agbalumo for the head title and logo. 

* Please note that the logo was conceptualized and created separately, and you can find a link to it here. The moodboard was created using the Adobe Illustrator app. Please refer to the image below for a visual representation.

* * ![Wireframe Mobile](media/ReadMe/moodboard/Moddboard%20for%20desgin%20UX.png)

## Colour Palette

* This moodboard features a visually appealing background cover image with a combination of dark grey, pink, and blue color palettes. However, to enhance the contrast, we have made a modification by replacing the colors with bright green and dark green. The new color scheme creates a pleasant and friendly aesthetic, making it more visually appealing. Please refer to the attached image for a better understanding.

## Testing browser compatibility

* Our comprehensive testing service guarantees browser compatibility across a wide range of popular browsers, such as Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and Firefox. With our rigorous testing process, you can be confident that your website or application will function seamlessly across these platforms.

* Microsoft Edge, 2. Unfortunately, if you are experiencing issues with Microsoft Edge on your laptop, it may be due to compatibility problems with older versions.

* To fully enjoy the benefits of Microsoft Edge, we recommend using it on a more up-to-date laptop that meets the system requirements. Upgrade your device to unlock the full potential of this innovative web browser and enjoy a faster, safer, and more efficient browsing experience.

* As an example, we have conducted extensive testing using the Safari browser, ensuring that your website is fully responsive and optimized for this specific platform. You can refer to the attached screenshot to see the exemplary results of our testing.

* While we thoroughly test for compatibility on various browsers, it is important to note that there may be slight variations in the appearance or functionality of certain elements. In the case of a minor discrepancy, such as a button placement in the bottom footer, we have made a conscious decision to maintain the original style without making any changes. Rest assured, this will not affect the overall user experience or functionality of your website.
