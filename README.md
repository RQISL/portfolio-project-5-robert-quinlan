## Please note: Irish Sign Language (ISL) is my first language, and English is my second language in writing.

* The [Ahrefs Writing Tools Product Description Generator]( https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools/product-description-generator) is a powerful tool specifically designed to assist non-native English speakers in creating professional and polished product descriptions. It has proven to be an invaluable resource for individuals looking to improve their English writing skills, despite the cost of subscriptions. With its ability to write and translate English clearly and concisely, users can confidently produce informative and engaging product descriptions. Whether you are a business owner or a content creator, the Ahrefs Writing Tools Product Description Generator is an essential tool for enhancing your English writing abilities.
* This particular tool was utilized in a site development project for an Art Gallery, showcasing its versatility and applicability across various industries.
* Although the tool did not meet the requirements for my demonstration in the ReadMe, I was able to work around it by writing in my second language and then editing the generated content from the AI generator.
* I sincerely hope that you have taken the time to read and understand the ReadMe document.

# Agile management

* For the Art Gallery project, a comprehensive solution was introduced for selling fine art frames. This solution was developed using Agile management, which involved an 18-stage process.

* The User Story for the project can be found at [User Story]( https://github.com/RQISL/portfolio-project-5-robert-quinlan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and [Milestone](https://github.com/RQISL/portfolio-project-5-robert-quinlan/milestones). The milestone showcases the progress made from start to finish, including screenshots of each stage.

## Create design UX for the Art Gallery site

*  [The RZ Collection](https://rzcollection.com/artists/ilgvars-zalans) website showcases stunning and seamless layout transitions that have inspired me during my exploration. The user experience (UX) on this site is truly remarkable, prompting me to develop my own UX concept. However, creating a design UX requires a significant amount of time, which unfortunately poses a challenge.

## Wireframe 

* ## Design wireframe UX for Desktop & Mobile
* A design UX that is almost similar to the one developed for the site. Please note that while the design UX may not be exact, it is still of the highest quality and has been developed with utmost care and attention to detail. 

* ## Desktop

## Moodboard
* The moodboard is a visual arrangement of images, materials, and text that aims to evoke a specific style or concept. It serves as a helpful tool to visualise the design direction for the website. In this particular moodboard, I have included labeled images for the hero cover background, color palettes, and the font choice of Roboto for all the text, while using Agbalumo for the head title and logo. 

* Please note that the logo was conceptualized and created separately, and you can find a link to it here. The moodboard was created using the Adobe Illustrator app. Please refer to the image below for a visual representation.

## Colour Palette

* This moodboard features a visually appealing background cover image with a combination of dark grey, pink, and blue color palettes. However, to enhance the contrast, we have modified it by replacing the colors with bright green and dark green. The new color scheme creates a pleasant and friendly aesthetic, making it more visually appealing. Please refer to the attached image for a better understanding.

### 4. Category Painting Page 

* As **<u>HTML, Python, Django, and Allauth</u>** I can create **<u>buy an art gallery including Allaut</u>** So that **<u>the user or company can buy a fine art gallery</u>**

1) There are four categories in the art group: Water Paint, Texture Paint, Oil Paint and Pencil Drawing. 
1) Each art gallery allows you to select and roll over to display the relevant information.
1) Additionally, you can add items to your basket and display them on the checkout page. 
1) On the checkout page, you'll need to fill in your address and indicate whether you would like to add a profile or not.

**<u>Please note as above mention No.1:**</u> Please note that before consulting with my client, I revised my concept project for the painting category. I changed it to include landscapes, nudes, and other themes. This was done while I collected her previous paintings from galleries through her photography.

* As **<u>HTML</u>** I can create **<u>a search page</u>** So that **<u>for users to find art galleries.**</u>

* #### Please note: However, I encountered an issue while testing the contact category. Although the category was created successfully, the sender was not receiving it on the administration page. Therefore, I made some changes to the contact page and now it is working better.

# User's Checkout Editable

## The lighthouse runs testing and results.

* This [Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev). is a test tool that analyzes the performance of a website on both desktop and mobile devices. It provides insights and recommendations based on the results obtained from running the test.

* The test results indicate that the mobile performance of the analyzed website is relatively low, suggesting potential areas for improvement. It has been proven to improve website results, even in cases where responsive images have caused performance issues. I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints.

## Validation testing

### HTML
* Run testing using [The 3WC HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for Home, About Us, Category Painting, Shop, Search Product, The Product Management, Profile, Login, Sign-up, Logout, and Contact pages have been meticulously reviewed and corrected to ensure optimal functionality. Our overlay model login and signup buttons remain unchanged. All passed!

### CSS
* Run testing using [the official (Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS. It was all passed and no errors.

### Python

* [The CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) is a powerful tool designed to identify and fix errors in Python code. With its extensive testing capabilities, it thoroughly scans your code and provides detailed feedback on any issues it finds. While it successfully resolves most errors, there may be a few instances where it is unable to make the necessary corrections. Additionally, there have been occasional issues with the tool causing errors when running the site. However, despite these minor setbacks, the CI Python Linter remains a reliable and effective solution for ensuring the quality and correctness of your Python code.

## Resource & tutorial
* #### I learned as many resources as possible I learned how to use Create for the cart, profile, and CRUD.

### Resources and tutorials:
* Most of the time I learned walkthrough at Aoutique Ado as it follows on my project 5 but mostly, I modified the way of site I created. I had quite an improved familiarity with Django and I enjoyed but it needs further experience to improve my skills in the field of Django.

## Technologies Used

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) I have used it since the beginning of Project 5

- [The CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) is a powerful tool that allows you to run tests and identify errors in your Python code. By using this linter, you can easily fix any bugs and ensure the quality of your code. Additionally, I found [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier#) to be extremely helpful in reducing stress and quickly identifying errors. This Python formatter and beautifier simplifies the process of finding and fixing errors. Simply copy and paste your code into the CI Python Linter, and it will highlight any errors for you to address. However, please note that some code may still have errors that cannot be changed to avoid any issues with the site.

## Acknowements

### Special thank you to those whose support due throughout the course as follows: 

* I would like to extend a special thank you to those who supported me throughout the course. Our mentor, Rory Sheridan, provided me with valuable advice on how to manage projects efficiently and avoid unnecessary complications. He also helped me understand that mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow and that taking control of the development process is key to achieving success. Additionally, he was an excellent tutor during our sessions together.

* Kamil Wojciechowski, who is the facilitator of our cohort, was very helpful. He sent me an example of a well-structured readme created by one of the students. I found the section on manual testing particularly useful, as it inspired me to create an excellent readme. This helped me to better understand what I needed to include in my manual tests.

* Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the Code Institute Tutor Support team for their assistance throughout the course.
